Ishika got stuck on an island. There is only one shop on this island and it is open on all days of the week except for Sunday. Consider following constraints:

N – The maximum unit of food you can buy each day.
S – Number of days you are required to survive.
M – Unit of food required each day to survive.
Currently, it’s Monday, and she needs to survive for the next S days.
Find the minimum number of days on which you need to buy food from the shop so that she can survive the next S days, or determine that it isn’t possible to survive.



class Solution{
public:
    int minimumDays(int S, int N, int M){
       int sundays=S/7;
       int buy_day=S-sundays;
       int total_food=S*M;
    int ans=0;
       if(total_food%N==0)
       ans=total_food/N;
       else
       ans=total_food/N +1;
       
       if(ans<=buy_day)
       return ans;
       else
       return -1;
    }
    
};
