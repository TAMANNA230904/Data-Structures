In a candy store, there are N different types of candies available and the prices of all the N different types of candies are provided to you.
You are now provided with an attractive offer.
For every candy you buy from the store and get K other candies ( all are different types ) for free.
Now you have to answer two questions. Firstly, you have to find what is the minimum amount of money you have to spend to buy all the N different candies. Secondly, you have to find what is the maximum amount of money you have to spend to buy all the N different candies.
In both the cases you must utilize the offer i.e. you buy one candy and get K other candies for free.

vector<int> candyStore(int candies[], int N, int K)
    {
        sort(candies,candies+N);
        int min=0,max=0;
        int buymin=0,freemin=N-1;
        while(buymin<=freemin){
            min+=candies[buymin];
            freemin-=K;
            buymin++;
        }
        
        int buymax=N-1,freemax=0;
        while(buymax>=freemax){
            max+=candies[buymax];
            freemax+=K;
            buymax--;
        }
        return {min,max};
    }
